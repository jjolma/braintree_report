BraintreeReport
===============

Client for accessing Braintree Payment Solution's reporting API.

To see their API: http://dev.braintreepaymentsolutions.com/query/

Note: this is really half-baked.  It supports the one use case I currently care about.

Example
=======

report = BraintreeReport.find(:username => 'testapi', :password => 'password1', :order_id => 'jpj_order_1257346416')
puts "transaction_id: #{r['transaction'][0]['transaction_id'][0]}"
puts "merchant defined fields: #{r.merchant_defined_field.inspect}"
